üß™ Your venv Compatibility Check
You're using Python 3.10.0, torch==2.2.2+cu118, and transformers==4.51.3. Here's the compatibility verdict:

‚úÖ Already Compatible in your venv:

All Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.)

Longformer, BigBird

T5, BART

Classical ML models (scikit-learn + joblib + threadpoolctl)

Tokenizers and HuggingFace Hub

CUDA via torch==2.2.2+cu118

‚ö†Ô∏è Need to Add for Multimodal Models:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pillow pytesseract torchvision opencv-python
(And install Tesseract OCR binary system-wide if using LayoutLMv3.)

Optional (for Donut/DocFormer):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install paddleocr
üì¶ Finalized requirements.txt Additions (New)
If you plan to support all of these models, you may append the following:

Copy
Edit
# Already in your venv:
transformers==4.51.3
torch==2.2.2+cu118

# For multimodal layout models:
pillow
pytesseract
torchvision
opencv-python

# Optional for Donut/DocFormer:
# paddleocr
üß† Notes on Execution
Use:

python
Copy
Edit
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)
to leverage GPU automatically if available.

For CPU fallback, optimize with n_jobs=-1 or torch.set_num_threads(...).

Let me know if you want a multi-model training script template that automatically switches models based on a flag!

I want you to thoroughly analyze the workspace.zip and tell me which other files depend on train_roberta.py. We will make a py script with train_models.py which will include all of these models to train them in one go (whether they are CUDA-enabled or CPU enabled ). Look

After thoroughly analyzing the contents of workspace.zip, here‚Äôs what I found:

üîç Dependency Analysis of train_roberta.py
‚úÖ Search Summary
All .py files were inspected.

Keyword matches for train_roberta (either import statements or function calls) were searched in all relevant files.

üìÇ Results
‚ùå No other Python files in the project explicitly depend on or import train_roberta.py.

This suggests:

train_roberta.py is either standalone, or

It is run manually for training without being integrated into a broader Python training framework (yet).

‚úÖ Next Steps
Since no current files depend on train_roberta.py, you're free to build a centralized train_models.py script that:

Imports all training logic from model-specific training files (e.g., RoBERTa, BERT, XLNet, etc.).

Auto-detects GPU availability.

Trains all models in one go using the same data and evaluation logic.

Would you like me to:

Create a train_models.py template that executes multiple models in one unified training loop?

Refactor train_roberta.py into a reusable function structure first?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
